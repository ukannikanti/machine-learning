    "***Transfer learning*** consists of taking features learned on one problem, and leveraging them on a new, similar problem. \n",

    "Usecase: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to train a \n",
    "    full-scale model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common incarnation of transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Take layers from a previously trained model.\n",
    "    2. Freeze them, so as to avoid destroying any of the information they contain during future training rounds.\n",
    "    3. Add some new, trainable layers on top of the frozen layers. They will learn to turn the old \n",
    "       features into predictions on a new dataset.\n",
    "    4. Train the new layers on your dataset.\n",
    "       \n",
    "Two ways to customize a pretrained model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Extraction:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the representations learned by a previous network to extract meaningful features from new samples. You simply add a new classifier, which will be trained from scratch, on top of the pretrained model so that you can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to (re)train the entire model. The base convolutional network already contains features that are generically useful for classifying pictures. However, the final, classification part of the pretrained model is specific to the original classification task, and subsequently specific to the set of classes on which the model was trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-Tuning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfreeze a few of the top layers of a frozen model base and jointly train both the newly-added classifier layers and the last layers of the base model. This allows us to \"fine-tune\" the higher-order feature representations in the base model in order to make them more relevant for the specific task."

    "\n",
    "The intuition behind transfer learning for image classification is that if a model is trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world. You can then take advantage of these learned feature maps without having to start from scratch by training a large model on a large dataset."
